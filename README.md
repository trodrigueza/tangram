# tangram

# How to win?
You have to complete all the silhouttes with the tangram figures leaving no white space.

# How to play?
You need a mouse or a keyboard. 
With the mouse you just drag the pieces and rotate them with the mouse's wheel. 
With the keyboard, you can select the figures with the numbers (1-7), move them fastly with wasd or slowly with the arrow keys and rotate them with q and e.

# Creating levels
In editor mode, you can create levels by constructing the figure-silhoutte you want the level to have and clicking on the save button. It will generate a json and you can send it to me in order to add it.
